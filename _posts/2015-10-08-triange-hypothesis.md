The triangle hypothesis: As sklls increase, salary increases exponentially. People with higher skill may still have lower salary. However people with a score lesser than a threshold, do not get salary above a point. There are two potential reasons for this; a. The market is only able to identify some high skilled folks and the rest remain hidden, thus their salaries remain low; b. Standardized assessments do not give a full skill assessment. If the skills are low as per the standardized test, it is certain that the person is not capable. However, if the skill is high, one may or may not be capable for the job.
