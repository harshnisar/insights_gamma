##Methodology

<p>A million undergraduates take AMCAT every year as a way to get job credentials and feedback to improve themselves. Random AMCAT takers were surveyed via email wherein they provided information on the jobs they are in and their corresponding annual salaries. Corresponding independent information about the candidates was recorded at the time of them taking AMCAT. Our analysis focuses on entry level engineering graduates.
